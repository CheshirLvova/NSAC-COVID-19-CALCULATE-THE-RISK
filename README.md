## COVID-19: CALCULATE THE RISK

##### [by Achievments hunters](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/covid-19-calculate-the-risk/teams/achievements-hunters/project)

Our challenge is to use open-source environmental data and other open-source information (such as epidemiological, social, policy and economic data) as available to build and demonstrate a prototype of smartphone web-application that can provide individualized, geolocated, COVID-19 risk warnings to guide social awareness, response, and health security.

The challenge involves use of risk warning models/algorithms as smart phone applications to advise users of their COVID risk; e.g., the application might provide the user with geolocated COVID-19 risk/susceptibility levels, which could guide individual decisions regarding what to wear (type of mask), which locations to avoid if possible (e.g., shopping, dining, social and sports gatherings), social distancing measures, and other exposure control measures.
